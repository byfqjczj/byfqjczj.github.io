                      <p>To start off the review, I must say I find Omori to be not a particularly well-made "video game". The gameplay itself feels secondary. Battles are rarely engaging on a mechanical level, and the pacing can be inconsistent, even sloggy, as if the game deliberately leans into tedium to serve its emotional tone and its narrative. In many places, it feels less like a game and more like a vessel for storytelling, using turn-based combat and exploration as narrative glue rather than as sources of enjoyment on their own.</p>

                      <p>Enemy design in particular reveals the limitations of the system. Minions rarely introduce new mechanics or force the player to rethink their strategy. Instead, they rely on either mood cycling, mood application, or raw damage, which lose their novelty early on. Boss fights, while visually and narratively distinct, tend to function as little more than stat checks—tests of whether the player has healed, leveled, or equipped properly rather than whether they understand or can master a unique mechanic, as boss movsets can basically be summarized as single target damage, AOE damage, or mood application (quite similar to minions, but much more stats). As a result, large stretches of the dream world sequences begin to feel dull, mechanically stagnant despite their visual creativity.</p>

                      <p>Outside of the JRPG-inspired combat, Omori's gameplay loop includes a fair number of puzzles and side quests. These are scattered throughout both the dream world and the real world segments, offering optional content. In theory, they should help flesh out the world or provide insight into the characters. However, I found most of these quests to be inconsequential. They rarely serve to deepen our understanding of the main cast, nor do they significantly expand on the world’s lore in a meaningful or lasting way (except for blackspace content, but I think they are exceptions).</p>
                      <p>This seems like a deliberate design choice, as Omori centralizes its characterization and worldbuilding in the main narrative arc, as the characterization of Sunny, Omori, their friends, and Mari is exclusively done in the main story, and side quests basically don't expand upon them at all. I don’t necessarily take issue with that choice, as there’s a certain artistic clarity in keeping the emotional and narrative stakes tightly focused, but it does make most of the side quests feel ultimately pointless. Without real narrative payoff, they become mildly entertaining diversions that neither challenge the player nor deepen their connection to the story.</p>
                      <p>I won’t speak too much about the puzzles, because Omori isn’t a puzzle game. Still, many of these segments, especially in areas like the Humphrey section, feel like they exist primarily to pad out game time. I also personally found them boring, but to each their own..</p>

                      <p>And this leaves the narrative part, which I find to be the best part of the game. The game’s exploration of Sunny’s mind is done through the lens of an unreliable narrator, and this choice never feels forced or contrived. Instead, it fits with the themes of repression, guilt, and avoidance. The gradual unveiling of Sunny’s past mirrors his slow descent into the absurd and morbid within his dreams, with Headspace growing increasingly unstable the closer he comes to confronting the truth. The breakdown of the whimsical dream world from the seemingly harmless fun of the space and castle area to the unsettling, claustrophobic Humphrey area and the unveiling of Black Space parallels his emotional unraveling in the real world, where his shell slowly breaks as he confronts his friends and his past. It’s a duality that works remarkably well: the collapse of fantasy and the confrontation with reality go hand in hand, each reinforcing the other. As the bright, colorful facade gives way to surreal horror and raw vulnerability, it reflects Sunny’s internal journey toward healing and accountability. This structure builds into a powerful and emotionally resonant ending. The decision to persevere and play the duet feels genuinely meaningful, not just as a narrative climax, but as a hard-earned moment of courage. After witnessing the emotional weight Sunny carries and the sheer difficulty of facing it, the choice feels real. You feel like you want to give up, but choosing not to makes that final act all the more impactful, culminating in a huge emotional payoff.</p>

                      <p>The aesthetics also fit the narrative very well, but I don't like talking about aesthetics too much, so I'll keep it brief. I liked the vibrant, purple-themed color palette chosen for the dream world and the comparatively muted but colorful palette of the real world, as they serve as a good contrast. I personally found Black Space's aesthetic of entirely filled with surreal monsters in black and white a bit tongue-in-cheek, but it is what it is.</p>

                      <p>Overall, I think Omori does a good job of having the aspects of the game serve its overall narrative, and it also has an interesting narrative. However, it does a pretty bad job as a "video game" with a very boring gameplay loop and bad replay value. I would give this game a 7/10, and would suggest Omocat to maybe make it a visual novel.</p>
