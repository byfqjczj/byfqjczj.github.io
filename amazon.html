                        <p>For the last 12 weeks, I had the opportunity to intern at Amazon Web Services as a software development intern. I just finished last Friday, and got a return offer(YAYYYY). I am super thankful for my team, who is super gracious and treated me with kindness. I am even more thankful for my mentor, who dedicated alot of his time to help me with technical aspects of my project, as well as providing feedback to make me not only a better engineer, but a better person.</p>

                        <p>Looking back, the biggest lessons learnt were never even about computer science or engineering, but about how to conduct myself as a person. One of the biggest flawed I learned about myself is that I am unable to accept ambiguity. Throughout the project, I would always ask my mentor about "feedback" in a thinly veiled attempt to gauge whether I am getting a return offer or not. Eventually, my mentor told me that dealing with ambiguity is a big part of problem solving, and that ambiguity is sometimes beyond the scope of the project itself. He helped me realize that there are things truly outside of my control, whether it's the return offer decision, unexpected blockers, or shifting priorities. Spending time worrying about those things only drains energy. What I can do, and what actually matters, is to focus on the parts I can control: writing clear code, asking thoughtful questions, documenting my work, and showing up with the right mindset. That perspective was difficult for me at first, but once I started to accept it, I found it much easier to concentrate on doing good work.</p>

                        <p>There are also some lessons to be learned about engineering, specifically about balancing prototyping MVPs with detailed design of the system. I was super quick to mock up solutions, and have a natural drive to create something that "works". However, I learned that creating a codebase that "works" is far from enough. Instead, it is the bare minimum. Most of the work goes into making sure that the code is scalable, self-explanatory, modular, robust(in regards to dependency and edge cases). An equally important part is the operational aspects of any software system such as alarms, mitigations, and documentation. I will say it is VERY hard to get everything right the first time around, but it is a good idea to keep all the aspects of software development in mind when creating your MVP so that I won't have to start from scratch after realizing there are some big design faults with the architecture of the MVP.</p>

                        <p>Overall, this summer has been one of the most rewarding experiences I've had. I grew not only as an engineer, but also as a teammate and as a person. I'm grateful for the chance to contribute to AWS, for the guidance and patience of my mentor, and for the kindness of my team. I'll carry these lessons with me wherever I go, and I'm excited to keep learning and growing as I take the next step forward.</p>
